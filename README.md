This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native applications: accessing a state variable before it has been initialized. This can lead to unexpected behavior and crashes, particularly if you attempt to perform arithmetic or other operations with the uninitialized state value.

The `bug.js` file shows the problematic code, where `count` is accessed directly without checking if it has been set. This may result in `undefined + 1` being evaluated. The `bugSolution.js` file presents solutions to avoid this error by using conditional rendering or providing a default state value.

This error occurs when you try to access a state variable before it has been initialized.  This often happens when you try to render a component before the state has finished updating.

```javascript
// Incorrect
function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>The count is: {count + 1}</Text> {/* Error: count might be undefined */}      <Button title="Increment" onPress={() => setCount(count + 1)} />
    </View>
  );
}
```
